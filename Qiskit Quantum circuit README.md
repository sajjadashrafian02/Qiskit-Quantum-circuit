# Qiskit Quantum Circuit Optimization  

Welcome to my Qiskit project! This repository is all about exploring how to design and optimize quantum circuits for real-world quantum computers. If you're curious about quantum computing or want to learn more about making circuits run efficiently on actual hardware, you're in the right place.  

## What’s This Project About?  
Quantum computers are powerful but come with unique challenges, especially when it comes to running quantum circuits on specific hardware. This project dives into transpilation, a process that helps make circuits compatible with quantum devices while also improving their efficiency.  

Using Qiskit, an open-source framework for quantum computing, I’ve put together examples of how we can:  
- Build quantum circuits step-by-step.  
- Optimize those circuits to make them hardware-compliant.  
- Get insights into how quantum computers process these circuits.  

## What’s Inside?  
- **`Qiskit_IBM.ipynb**`: A Jupyter Notebook that walks you through the whole process—from creating circuits to optimizing them for IBM's quantum hardware.  

## What You’ll Need  
Before you dive in, make sure you’ve got the following:  
- Python 3.7+  
- Qiskit (install it using pip install qiskit)  
- Jupyter Notebook (install it using pip install notebook)  

## Getting Started  
1. Clone this repository to your computer:  
   ``` bash  
   git clone https://github.com/sajjadashrafian02/Qiskit-Quantum-circuit 
   cd Qiskit-Quantum-circuit
   
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash  
   pip install qiskit notebook

4. open the notebook:
   ```bash  
   jupyter notebook

5. Run ```Qislit_IBM.ipynb and follow along!
 You’ll see how circuits are created and optimized step by step.

## Why Does This Matter?
Quantum computing is still in its early days, and making circuits run efficiently on hardware is a big challenge. This project is a small contribution to understanding how we can make quantum computers more practical and effective.
